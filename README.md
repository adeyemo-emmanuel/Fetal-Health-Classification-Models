# Fetal-Health-Classification-Models

Overview

This notebook explores various machine learning models to classify fetal health based on physiological parameters. The dataset used contains features related to fetal heart rate, uterine contractions, and other indicators, with the target variable indicating the health status of the fetus as normal, suspect, or pathological.
